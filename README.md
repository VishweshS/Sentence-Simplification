# Sentence Simplification
My work at MT-NLP lab (IIIT-Hyderabad)<br />

1. Explored the various deep learning methods and the datasets for the sentence simplification task, performed error analysis for each method.
2. Implemented the state of the art method for Split and Rephrase task (subtask of sentence simplification) and identified the types of errors. Refer to [Seq2Seq_Copy](https://github.com/VishweshS/Sentence-Simplification/tree/master/Seq2Seq_Copy) for details.
3. Performed various experiments to identify a way to eliminate the errors identified. Refer to [experiments](https://github.com/VishweshS/Sentence-Simplification/tree/master/experiments) for details.
4. Proposed and implemented the reward augmented maximum likelihood objective for Split and Rephrase task. Refer to [RML](https://github.com/VishweshS/Sentence-Simplification/tree/master/RML) for details.
5. Compared the results of the built model with that of the state of the art method.

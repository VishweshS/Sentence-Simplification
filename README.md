# Sentence Simplification
Work done at MT-NLP lab (IIIT-Hyderabad)<br/>

1. Explored the various deep learning methods and the datasets for the sentence simplification task, and performed error analysis for each method.
2. Implemented the state-of-the-art method for the Split and Rephrase task (subtask of sentence simplification) and identified the different types of errors. Refer to [Seq2Seq_Copy](https://github.com/VishweshS/Sentence-Simplification/tree/master/Seq2Seq_Copy) for details.
3. Performed various experiments to identify a way to eliminate the errors identified. Refer to [experiments](https://github.com/VishweshS/Sentence-Simplification/tree/master/experiments) for details.
4. Proposed and implemented the reward augmented maximum likelihood objective for the Split and Rephrase task. Refer to [RML](https://github.com/VishweshS/Sentence-Simplification/tree/master/RML) for details.
5. Compared the results of the built model with that of the state-of-the-art method.
